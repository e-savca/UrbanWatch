# UrbanWatch

> This pet project is an ASP.NET Core application that uses different technologies and frameworks to show real-time locations of public transportation on a map.

## Description
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my software development skills and explore new technologies and concepts.

Please check out the live demo of the project at **[urbanwatch.azurewebsites.net](https://urbanwatch.azurewebsites.net/)** to see it in action.

### **Inspiration**
I was inspired to create this project to test my abilities in ASP.NET Core and learn new technologies. The challenge was to integrate real-time data, like the positions of public transportation, into an application and display them to users. Additionally, this project helps me quickly find the real-time locations of public transportation, which is personally beneficial.

### **Technical Challenges**
During the development process, I faced several technical challenges. It was my first time working with AutoMapper, so I had to do additional research to successfully implement it. Additionally, I had to establish a connection to the database using Entity Framework, which was a new experience for me.

### **Reliability and Performance**
To ensure the application's reliability and performance, especially when dealing with real-time data, I implemented a class called **`DataSnapshot`**. This class temporarily stores the data until new data is obtained from the data providers. Every 10 seconds, it checks if the data source (**`TranzyDataProvider`**) has updated its data. It also verifies that the new data does not contain duplicates with the already saved data. Finally, the new data is added to the database.

## Features and Functionalities
The application offers the following key features and functionalities:

- Retrieving data from an HTTP Web API
- Displaying the acquired data on an OpenStreetMap using the LeafletJS library
- Showing the stations and route path of the selected route on the map
- Tracking the real-time positions of public transportation for the selected route

Moreover, the project can be configured to use an Entity Framework (EF) database or work solely with in-memory data.

## Architecture

The UrbanWatch project has a flexible architecture that supports different data storage options. The configuration of the project can be adjusted through the `appsettings.json` file, specifically in the "DatabaseSettings" section.

### With Database

When the "UseDatabase" setting is set to true in the `appsettings.json` file, the project utilizes Entity Framework (EF) to connect to a database backend. This enables efficient storage, retrieval, and querying of data. The database can store essential information like routes, stops, and real-time vehicle positions.

This approach offers benefits such as persistent data storage, scalability, and advanced querying capabilities. It ensures data integrity and allows for smooth integration with existing database systems.

### In-Memory Data

Alternatively, when the "UseDatabase" setting is set to false in the `appsettings.json` file, the project works solely with in-memory data. In this mode, data is stored and managed within the application's memory during runtime. This option is suitable for scenarios where data persistence is not required or when quick prototyping or testing is the main focus.

Using in-memory data provides faster access and eliminates the need for external database dependencies. However, please note that any changes made to the data will not persist beyond the application's runtime.

By offering the flexibility to configure the project's data storage through the `appsettings.json` file, the UrbanWatch project empowers developers to adapt the architecture to their specific requirements and limitations.

## Installation and Usage

### ****Using**** .NET Core CLI or ****Visual Studio****

1. Clone this repository: **`git clone https://github.com/e-savca/UrbanWatch.git`**
2. Navigate to the project directory: **`cd UrbanWatch`**
3. Install dependencies: **`dotnet restore`**
4. Run the project:
    - Using .NET Core CLI: Execute the command **`dotnet run`** to start the application.
    - Using Visual Studio: Press F5 or select "Start" to run the application.

### ****Using Docker container****

To run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. Download the Docker image from Docker Hub: [eusavca/urbanwatch](https://hub.docker.com/r/eusavca/urbanwatch)    
    ```
    docker pull eusavca/urbanwatch    
    ```    
2. Start the Docker container:    
    ```
    docker run -p 80:80 eusavca/urbanwatch    
    ```
    This will start the UrbanWatch application in a Docker container and link the container's port 80 to the host's port 80. You can then access the application in your browser at **`http://localhost`**.
